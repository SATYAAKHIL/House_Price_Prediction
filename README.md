#House_Price_Prediction
Multiple Linear Regression is used to predict the price of the houses based on different 14 independent variables.
This repository is directly pushed from pycharm (Python IDE), I used flask to deploy it.
This repo consists of:
1)Flask(Web framework) in:app.py
2)Dataset: House_modified.csv
3)Machine learning model : project1_house_price_prediction
4)Template:index.html
4)CSS & fonts in : static folder.

These 4 directories will help you to create and deploy a finished machine learning model onto the website.
